--Interpretation Between Horsepower and Weight:
--A positive correlation is expected.
--This means as horsepower increases, weight will also increase.
--Cars with higher horsepower are usually heavier but accelerate faster.

--Interpretation Between MEAN,MEDIAN,STANDARD DEVIATION
--Mean vs. Median:

--For Horsepower and Weight the mean is higher than the median, which indicates a right-skewed distribution.
--For Accel the mean and median are close, a symmetric distribution.
Standard Deviation:

--Horsepower (38.77) and Weight (847.00) show high variability,
Accel (2.80) has low variability.
